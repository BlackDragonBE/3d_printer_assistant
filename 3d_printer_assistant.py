		I want to 3D print an object using an FDM 3D printer. Based on the information I give, tell me what the ideal type(s) of filament would be. Some examples of filament types: PLA, PETG, TPU/TPE, ASA, Nylon, PVA, HIPS, Carbon fiber. Also consider other filament types.
		Explain your answer. Consider where the material will be used and how hot it might get. If the print might be used inside of a car it might get hot for example, so PLA would no be suitable. Also give the following recommendations for the material(s):
		- Printing temperature
		- Bed temperature
		- Extra considerations
